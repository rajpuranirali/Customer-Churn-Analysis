# Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in a telecom company. By understanding why customers leave (churn), companies can take steps to improve retention, reduce customer loss, and ultimately enhance business growth. This analysis explores customer data and applies predictive modeling to forecast which customers are likely to churn.

## Project Goal
- Explore the data: Analyze the relationship between customer characteristics and churn.
- Build predictive models: Develop a model to predict churn based on customer features using machine learning algorithms.
- Provide insights: Identify key factors leading to customer churn and suggest strategies to retain customers.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python: The primary language for this project.
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Numerical operations.
- matplotlib & seaborn: Visualization of data and results.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for modeling and evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebook: The environment used for executing the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is from the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. It contains information about customers, such as:
- Customer ID
- Demographic information (e.g., age, gender)
- Subscription details (e.g., contract type, internet service, etc.)
- The Churn column, which indicates whether a customer has left the service (1 for churn, 0 for staying).

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and ensure proper data types.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize customer data to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- Identify trends and insights that may relate to customer churn (e.g., service type, contract length).

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Convert categorical variables into numerical values using encoding techniques.
- Scale numerical features to improve model performance.

### 4. Model Building
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest).
- Evaluate models using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Compare model performance and analyze confusion matrices.
- Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

### 6. Key Insights & Recommendations
- Identify the top features that influence customer churn.
- Provide recommendations on how the telecom company can improve customer retention (e.g., targeted offers, better customer service).

## How to Run
